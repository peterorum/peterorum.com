            <i>"You are what you google"</i></h3>
        <p>
            Over the last few years, the massive increase in cheap disk capacity and networks
            has meant that internet search engines such as Google <i>need never delete anything</i>.
            All searches are kept indefinitely, linked back to the individual. Search trails
            like this provide data for profiling, enabling more individually-targeted advertising,
            and can also be used for anti-terrorism surveillance, which most people would agree
            is a good thing. Until they are falsely accused. In my view, this &ldquo;facility&rdquo;
            raises extreme privacy issues for society. How much of our privacy and increased
            risk of identity theft are we prepared to trade away for convenience &amp; security?</p>
        <p>
            I've spent many years developing software, working with numbers, databases &amp;
            program code, watching with some horror, this amassing of portrait surveillance
            on everybody. Due to my own strong sense of privacy, I find this trend particularly
            disturbing. My paintings are in essence a protest against this. The underlying textures
            of my paintings include identification numbers, common search phrases and XML Database
            notation. I've tried to bring a representation of the digital world, and in effect,
            my world, to the traditional medium of painting, as opposed to using my computer
            skills to make digital art.</p>
        <p>
            The six paintings that follow represent a sequence, from the most popular kinds
            of searches people currently make, while being constantly watched, through to having
            our personalities assimilated into corporate and government databases. Now, instead
            of representing personalities symbolically in portraits, we are living in a world
            where personalities are represented digitally, created from search histories and
            social networking sites.</p>
        <p>
            <i>Figures</i> (Fig 22) has reference to Jasper Johns' Numbers series, although
            my work was using a computer-based octal sequence (0 to 7). Johns used numbers as
            painting subjects. Before Johns, numbers had traditionally been ignored as visual
            objects in their own right in art. Today, people's personalities are being converted
            to numbers. Our thoughts, desires and interests are being compiled into databases,
            and numbers are becoming ever more pervasive.</p>
        <p>
            My use of repetition also comes from my love of trance music, and the repetitive
            nature of daily working life, during which, despite my protests, I constantly use
            Google and have little option to boycott it.</p>
