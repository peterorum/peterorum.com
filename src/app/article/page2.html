            Fractal drawings</h3>
        <p>
            In the drawings project of the Abstraction unit, I explored the transformation of
            computer-generated fractal images into the medium of painting. I used my own computer-generated
            images as a source in the same way that an urban landscape artist would use city
            scenes as a source. The longer term goal remains to find motifs and new imagery
            that can sustain a series of paintings, and to see if mathematically derived images
            can produce new interesting drawn images of a kind not seen before, in that they
            are not derived from the &ldquo;real&rdquo; world. However, my aim is to avoid the
            standard mathematical art of spheroid-type shapes.</p>
        <p>
            One of my projects in the subject Abstraction used fractals as the source of images,
            but not just the traditional Mandelbrot style, but rather those involving angular
            and circular modifications. I related these to the City Rail ticket-based images
            I had done in earlier Painting subjects and in extra-curricular projects.</p>
        <p>
            The challenge was to produce an image that is as visually interesting as the one
            first captured on the computer screen, but which also stands alone as a painting.
            The aim was not to produce a pixel-perfect photo-realistic direct copy, otherwise
            all that would be needed would be a computer-printout. I wanted the painted images
            to highlight some of the features of the painting medium itself, such as texture
            and painterliness (e.g. broken colour &amp; brush strokes).</p>
        <p>
            For the Abstraction unit drawing project, I selected a dozen angular fractals to
            be drawn in charcoal on A1 paper, three examples of which are shown below. Figures
            1, 3 and 5 show the original computer fractal images, and figures 2, 4 and 6 show
            the corresponding charcoal drawing. Figure 8 shows a later painting based on the
            fractal drawing in figure 7.</p>
