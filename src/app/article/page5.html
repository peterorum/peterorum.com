            Etching</h3>
        <p>
            The series of etchings was a cohesive project by virtue of the topic, medium and
            process. The project was loosely defined as something autobiographical, and we were
            given two small 20x25cm zinc plates, which were used for the entire course. Images
            were etched, and then almost completely scraped off as best as possible, with new
            drawings and techniques applied over the top throughout the course.</p>
        <p>
            The autobiographical aspect I chose to describe was aspects of my daily life. On
            the original plates, called My Day </I>(Figure 16), the left-hand image was based
            on using public transport (continuing the theme of my earlier ticket series), and
            journeying either to work on computers or to work on an easel. The right-hand image
            is based on a page from my work notebook, comprising scraps of programming, maths,
            doodles, phone messages and designs. The next generation, <i>Ticket to Ryde </i>
            (Figure 17), had ticket motifs etched over the top. After a lot of burnishing to
            try and remove most of these images from the plates, new drawings were overlain
            consisting of references to web page design, including standard buttons like Home
            and Print, cursor arrows, scrollbars, along with some of the underlying html code,
            e.g. &lt;body&gt; tags, producing <i>Home Page </i>(figure 18).</p>

            A separate small etching was made of a numeric key pad.
