            Screen-printing</h3>
        <p>
            Fractal images were also used for some of my projects in Screenprinting. A canvas-like
            texture was sought to emulate a painterly-look, albeit with an exaggerated weave
            size. It was an interesting amalgam of the three media &ndash; printmaking, digital
            and painting. The very fine detail involved with the fractal made it somewhat unsuitable
            for screen-printing, as the points can be smaller than the gaps in the screen, but
            nonetheless I was keen to experiment.. Figure 9 shows the canvas texture in the
            first layer, with an abstract design printed next and the fractal as the top layer.
            Figure 10 was printed with the layers in reverse order.</p>
