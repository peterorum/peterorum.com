<h3>Genetic Tickets</h3>
<p>
    Another project in Abstraction, <i>Genetic Tickets </i>(figure 11), aimed to generate
            paintings using a strictly defined procedure, similar to Sol Lewitt, in that technically
            someone else could produce the works by following the documented steps. A very detailed
            computer algorithm based on genetics was used. In an earlier series of paintings
            involving train tickets, I had noticed each ticket had a unique serial number, which
            could be likened to each individual person's DNA. The idea was to use this serial
            number to have each ticket create its own unique painting in that way that our own
            DNA defines us. The procedure was as follows:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p>
            16 City Rail tickets were chosen at random, each to result in a small 20x25cm painting.
        </p>
        <li>
            <p>
                Each had their serial number converted to binary, as series of over forty ones and
                        zeros, each called a <i>bit</i>. e.g. Typing <i>1234 in binary</i> into Google will
                        convert 1,234 to 10011010010. This is similar to a chromosome.
            </p>
            <li>
                <p>
                    A few objects were chosen to make up the painting, namely a triangle, circle, dark
                            bar and light bar, plus the background, based on the abstract T<i>icket 2</i> (fig
                            13).
                </p>
            </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            The background would have its color defined by hue, saturation and lightness numbers.
                                The hue and saturation were defined by the serial number. All the paintings had
                                the same high Lightness to provide unity.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Each object's position and orientation was also be specified by the serial number,
                                    using a limited number of options, e.g. Top corner, left facing etc.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Each serial number's zeros and ones were divided into groups. Each group was of
                                        sufficient size to provide just enough options for that attribute. A value with
                                        just two options only needed one bit, which can be zero or one. Two bits has four
                                        variations. And so on.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            For example, the background hue was given 16 options, which requires 4 bits. The
                                            last four bits of each binary serial number defined its hue.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            The next two bits defined the background saturation, 0% (gray), 25%, 75% 100%.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            Figure 14 shows some of my workings at the time.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            The triangle hue had four possible values &ndash; same as background, complement
                                                        of the background, or plus or minus two steps on a colour wheel.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>
            The default values of the various numbers represented were defined by the results
                                                            of the very first square, whose colors and positions were designed to match that
                                                            of the large previous abstraction ticket painting project I had done. (Figure 13).
                                                            i.e. for the very first ticket, if its Hue value was 8, then hue 8 was defined to
                                                            be orange, to match the original painting.
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>

    This procedure of identifying the attribute of an object by a long series of zeros
            and ones is exactly the process used in computer science when using a genetic algorithm
            to solve a complicated optimization problem, e.g. timetable scheduling. I found it an interesting process to follow, and I like the way an object can deterministically
            define an abstraction representation of itself.
