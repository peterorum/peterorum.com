        Having been a software developer for many years, I am particularly interested in importing
            that knowledge and process into the traditional medium of painting, rather than
            simply staying with my computer skills and using new digital mediums. This essay focuses on those particular works, as they interested me most. There was a development
            in my work over the course from first just copying digital images, then creating
            paintings using programming methods, through to paintings about the social impact
            of computers, networks and databases and their impact on privacy.
